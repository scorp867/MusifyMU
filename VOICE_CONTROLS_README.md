# Voice Controls - Gym Mode

## Overview
Musify MU now includes voice controls that allow you to control music playback using voice commands through your headset microphone. This feature is specifically designed for gym use where your hands might be busy.

## Features
- **Headset Microphone Only**: Uses only the headset microphone (wired or Bluetooth), never the device's built-in microphone
- **Automatic Detection**: Automatically detects when headphones are connected
- **Smart Audio Routing**: Forces audio routing to headset for optimal voice recognition
- **Voice Commands**: Supports all major playback controls via voice

## How to Enable
1. Connect your headphones (wired or Bluetooth)
2. Open the Now Playing screen
3. Tap the "More" button (â‹®) in the top right corner
4. Toggle "Gym Mode" to ON

- `MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS`: For audio routing control

## Troubleshooting

## Safety Notes
