  - `PlaybackUseCase`: Manages playback state and queue operations
  - `StateManagementUseCase`: Handles app state persistence
  - `QueueManagementUseCase`: Manages queue operations with state persistence

#### B. ViewModel Refactoring
- **LibraryViewModel**: Now uses use cases instead of direct repository access
  - Proper UI state management with `LibraryUiState`
  - Error handling and loading states
  - Reactive data streams with proper lifecycle management
  
- **HomeViewModel**: Enhanced with better state management
  - Parallel data loading for better performance
  - Proper error handling and recovery
  - Integrated playlist management

- **SearchViewModel**: Improved with caching and debouncing
  - Search result caching for better performance
  - Debounced search to reduce unnecessary operations
  - Category-based search functionality

#### C. Domain Models
- `TrackWithPlaybackInfo`: Domain model combining track data with playback state
- Proper separation between data models and domain models

## 2. Dependency Injection Improvements ✅

### Problems Identified:
- Missing use cases in DI configuration
- No proper caching strategy injection
- Missing service layer components

### Solutions Implemented:

#### A. New DI Modules
- **UseCaseModule**: Provides all use cases with proper dependencies

- Added `MediaScanningService` for centralized scanning

#### C. Proper Singleton Management
- All components properly scoped as singletons where appropriate
- Circular dependency prevention
- Lazy initialization where needed

## 3. Scanning and Artwork Extraction Deduplication ✅

### Problems Identified:
- Artwork extraction scattered across multiple places
- Duplicate scanning operations
- No centralized artwork management

### Solutions Implemented:

#### A. MediaScanningService
- **Centralized Scanning**: Single point for all media scanning operations
- **Automatic Artwork Extraction**: Triggered when tracks are discovered
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient artwork extraction in batches
- **Priority-based Processing**: High/Normal/Low priority artwork loading

#### B. Unified Artwork Management
- All artwork requests go through `ArtworkUseCase`
- Centralized caching through `CacheStrategy`
- Elimination of duplicate extraction operations
- Memory and disk cache coordination

## 4. Proper Caching Strategy ✅

### Problems Identified:
- No comprehensive caching strategy
- Missing artwork caching
- No cache cleanup mechanisms

### Solutions Implemented:

#### A. Multi-Layer Caching
- **Memory Cache**: LRU cache for frequently accessed items
- **Disk Cache**: Persistent storage for artwork and metadata
- **Database Cache**: Structured data with relationships
- **Search Cache**: Cached search results for better performance

#### B. CacheStrategy Class
- **Intelligent Storage**: Priority-based caching decisions
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Size-based and time-based eviction
- **Cache Statistics**: Monitoring and debugging capabilities
- **Preloading Strategies**: Different strategies for different use cases

#### C. CacheManager
- Thread-safe operations with mutexes
- Efficient LRU implementation
- Cache hit/miss tracking
- Comprehensive cache statistics

## 5. State Management and Restoration ✅

### Problems Identified:
- Incomplete state saving/restoring
- No proper playback continuation
- Queue state not properly persisted

### Solutions Implemented:

#### A. StateManagementUseCase
- **Comprehensive State**: App state, playback state, and queue state
- **DataStore Integration**: Modern Android state persistence
- **Restoration Logic**: Smart restoration based on recency
- **State Versioning**: Handle app updates gracefully

#### B. PlaybackStateService
- **Automatic State Saving**: Periodic and event-based saving
- **Lifecycle Awareness**: Save state on app backgrounding
- **Queue State Persistence**: Complete queue restoration
- **Position Restoration**: Resume playback at exact position

#### C. Enhanced State Models
- `AppState`: Complete app state model
- `PlaybackState`: Playback-specific state
- `QueueState`: Queue-specific state with play-next and user queue

## 6. Repository Pattern Improvements ✅

### Problems Identified:
- Basic repository implementation
- No proper error handling
- Missing caching integration

### Solutions Implemented:

#### A. EnhancedLibraryRepository
- **Result Pattern**: Proper error handling with Result<T>
- **Cache Integration**: Intelligent cache-first operations
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Multiple data source fallbacks
- **Reactive Streams**: Proper Flow integration

#### B. Data Source Coordination
- **Cache-First Strategy**: Check cache before expensive operations
- **Database Fallback**: Fallback to database when cache is empty
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful error handling and recovery

## 7. Queue Management Optimization ✅

### Problems Identified:
- Queue operations not integrated with state management
- No proper queue state persistence
- Missing queue operation use cases

### Solutions Implemented:

#### A. QueueManagementUseCase
- **State-Aware Operations**: All queue operations trigger state saving
- **Proper Abstraction**: Clean interface for queue operations
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and recovery

#### B. Enhanced Queue Integration
- **Automatic State Saving**: Queue changes automatically saved
- **Restoration Support**: Complete queue restoration on app restart
- **Source Playlist Updates**: Smart handling of playlist changes

## 8. Testing and Integration ✅

### Solutions Implemented:

#### A. Integration Testing
- **ArchitectureIntegrationTest**: Comprehensive integration test
- **MVVM Pattern Verification**: Ensures proper architectural patterns
