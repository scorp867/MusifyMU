# Enhanced Queue System - Spotify-Like Implementation

## Overview

Your queue system has been significantly enhanced to match and exceed Spotify's sophisticated queue management capabilities. The system now provides intelligent queue isolation, seamless drag & drop, smart cleanup, and advanced visual feedback.

## üéØ Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Three-Queue Architecture** ‚úÖ
- **Priority Queue (Play Next)**: Immediate playback after current song
- **User Queue**: User-added songs that play after priority items
- **Main Queue**: Original playlist/album/context items

### 2. **Queue Isolation** üîí
- Priority and User queue items are **completely isolated** from source changes
- When a playlist is updated, only main queue items are affected
- Isolated items retain their position and won't disappear unexpectedly
- Visual indicators show isolation status

### 3. **Intelligent Song Removal** üß†
- Automatically removes played songs from the queue
- **Smart preservation**: Recently added priority items can be kept even after playing
- Configurable cleanup thresholds (5-minute window for priority items)
- Fallback mechanisms prevent queue corruption

### 4. **Advanced Drag & Drop** üé®
- Seamless reordering between different queue segments
- Visual feedback shows which segment items belong to
- Hardware-accelerated animations for 60fps performance
- Smart queue type conversion when dragging between segments

### 5. **Context Awareness** üìç
- Tracks original source (album, playlist, artist, etc.)
- Preserves context information for recommendations
- Source-specific operations (update/remove by source)

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Enhanced QueueItem Structure
```kotlin
data class QueueItem(
    val mediaItem: MediaItem,
    val id: String = mediaItem.mediaId,
    val addedAt: Long = System.currentTimeMillis(),
    val source: QueueSource = QueueSource.USER_ADDED,
    var position: Int = -1,
    val context: PlayContext? = null,
    val isIsolated: Boolean = false, // NEW: Protection from source changes
    val originalSourceId: String? = null, // NEW: Track source for updates
    val userMetadata: Map<String, Any> = emptyMap() // NEW: User preferences
)
```

### New Queue Management Methods

#### Source Isolation
```kotlin
// Update playlist without affecting queue items
suspend fun updateSourcePlaylist(
    newItems: List<MediaItem>, 
    sourceId: String, 
    preserveCurrentPosition: Boolean = true
)

// Remove items from specific source while preserving isolated items
suspend fun removeItemsFromSource(sourceId: String)
```

#### Intelligent Cleanup
```kotlin
// Enhanced trimming with smart preservation
private suspend fun trimPlayedBeforeCurrent()
```

#### Queue Statistics
```kotlin
// Get detailed queue information
fun getQueueStatistics(): QueueStatistics
```

## üé® Visual Enhancements

### Queue Type Indicators
- **"NEXT"** badge: Purple badge for priority queue items
- **"YOU"** badge: Blue badge for user queue items  
- **Lock icon**: Shows isolated items in main queue
- **Visual separation**: Clear headers for different queue segments

### Enhanced Drag & Drop
- **Instant feedback**: Hardware-accelerated animations
- **Smart previews**: Shows destination queue type during drag
- **Edge scrolling**: Smooth auto-scroll near list edges
- **Drop zones**: Visual indicators for valid drop targets

### Snackbar Notifications
- **Queue cleanup**: "Cleaned X played songs (kept Y)"
- **Item isolation**: Clear feedback when items are protected
- **Drag operations**: Confirmation of queue changes

## üöÄ Performance Optimizations

### Hardware Acceleration
- GPU-accelerated transformations during drag operations
- Efficient rendering with `CompositingStrategy.Offscreen`
- Optimized animation curves for natural feel

### Memory Management
- Efficient queue operations with proper mutex locking
- Background processing for bulk operations
- Smart cleanup to prevent memory leaks

### Thread Safety
- All queue operations are thread-safe with coroutines
- Non-blocking UI updates with StateFlow/LiveData
- Proper error handling and fallbacks

## üéµ Spotify-Like Behaviors

### ‚úÖ **Queue Reordering**
- Drag items between Priority, User, and Main segments
- Smart conversion when moving between queue types
- Preserves playback without interruption

### ‚úÖ **Intelligent Removal**
- Automatically removes played songs
- Keeps recently added priority items if marked
- User can configure cleanup behavior

### ‚úÖ **Add to Queue vs Play Next**
- **Add to Queue**: Goes to User Queue segment
- **Play Next**: Goes to Priority Queue (immediate)
- Both are isolated from source playlist changes

### ‚úÖ **Drag & Drop Seamless**
- 60fps smooth animations
- Visual feedback during drag
- Smart snapping to valid positions
- Hardware-accelerated rendering

### ‚úÖ **Source Independence**
- Priority and User queue items remain when playlist changes
- Only main queue reflects source updates
- Visual indicators show item protection status

## üìä Queue Statistics

The system now provides detailed statistics:
- Total items across all segments
- Items per queue type (Priority/User/Main)
- Number of isolated items
- Active source count
- Current position and navigation status

## üîÑ Migration & Compatibility

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing queue operations continue to work
- Legacy methods automatically route to appropriate queue segments
- Existing UI components enhanced without breaking changes

### New Methods Available
```kotlin
// Enhanced operations
queueOperations.updateSourcePlaylist(newItems, sourceId)
queueOperations.removeItemsFromSource(sourceId)
queueOperations.playNextWithKeepOption(items, context, keepAfterPlay = true)
queueOperations.getQueueStatistics()
```

## üéØ Usage Examples

### Adding Songs with Isolation
```kotlin
// Add to priority queue (isolated)
queueOperations.playNextWithContext(listOf(mediaItem), context)

// Add to user queue (isolated)
queueOperations.addToUserQueueWithContext(listOf(mediaItem), context)
```

### Updating Playlists Safely
```kotlin
// Update playlist without affecting queue
queueOperations.updateSourcePlaylist(newPlaylistItems, playlistId)
```

### Smart Cleanup Configuration
```kotlin
// Priority items marked to keep after playing
queueOperations.playNextWithKeepOption(
    items = listOf(mediaItem),
    context = context,
    keepAfterPlay = true // Will survive cleanup for 5 minutes
)
```

## üêõ Error Handling

### Robust Fallbacks
- Queue corruption prevention with try-catch blocks
- Automatic recovery from failed operations
- Graceful degradation when operations fail
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

### Edge Cases Handled
- Empty queue states
- Invalid drag operations
- Concurrent modification protection
- Player state synchronization

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

The system is designed for extensibility:
- **Smart Recommendations**: Context-aware next song suggestions
- **Cross-Device Sync**: Queue state synchronization
- **Advanced Shuffle**: ML-based intelligent shuffle
- **Queue Presets**: Save and restore queue configurations
- **Collaborative Queues**: Multi-user queue management
